## General Feedback

Your code is well structured and readable. good! 
Your navigation is not structured 100% correctly. If you want to have nested lists you need to put an <ul> as child of an <li>. It works in most browsers anyway, but technically its not correct.

I really like the way, you went the extra mile of including the map with multiple markers.


## Design
I already told you, that i really love your design. We just need to make sure to make responsive in the next steps.
Also you need to be carful not to include too many resources like fonts, large images etc. When hosted that will slow down you page load.
